  - Token-based pricing is understood.
- You prefer browser-based implementations over server-side.

✅ Technical Accomplishments
- Successfully used:
  - OpenAI translation API, with `format: "html"` support.
  - OpenAI TTS via JavaScript.
  - OpenAI STT (Whisper) via audio upload.
- Compared Google Translate vs. ChatGPT for serious content, preferred ChatGPT.

✅ Miscellaneous Technical Topics Covered
- Filtering object arrays in JavaScript.
- Recording in `.webm` and converting to `.mp3` using FFmpeg.js (in browser).
- Dealing with touch events and mobile selection behavior in web apps.
- Sending emails via EmailJS from the browser.
- Explored GitHub Pages and Firebase for deployment/backend options.

✅ Next Steps
- You're ready to start a new conversation focused on UI/UX, architecture, or advanced features.
